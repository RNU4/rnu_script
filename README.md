# rnu_script

TCC needed to compile, GCC also works.

It is still a work in progress and the virtual machine is missing some instructions

Compiler works but need to be rewritten to include better error handling and scalability.

you can test it with using the precompiled app.exe [filename]. file.rnu and file2.rnu are example programs.

file2.rnu contains a example of a hashmap jumptable and some other stuff.

file.rnu is a mix of different functionality.
